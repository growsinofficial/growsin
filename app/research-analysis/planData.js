    title: 'RA Service: Swing Trading Ideas',
    details: `
      <h5>Overview</h5>
      <p>Swing trading is a strategy where traders hold positions for a few days to a few weeks to capture short- to medium-term price movements in stocks. Unlike intraday trading, which requires constant monitoring, swing trading allows investors to participate in market opportunities without being glued to the screen all day.</p>
      <p>As a SEBI-registered Research Analyst (RA), I provide well-researched swing trading ideas backed by both technical and fundamental analysis. The goal is to help clients capture short-term opportunities with defined risk management while avoiding noise and guesswork.</p>
      
      <h5>What This Service Offers</h5>
      <p><strong>1. Swing Trade Ideas</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>8–10 actionable ideas per month.</li>
        <li>Each idea includes: Stock name & sector, Entry price (buy/sell range), Stop-loss level (risk control), Target price (expected reward), Recommended holding period, and Clear reasoning behind the idea (charts, patterns, or fundamentals).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>2. Research & Analysis</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ideas are based on a blend of technical indicators (chart patterns, moving averages, RSI, MACD) and fundamental triggers (earnings, news flows, sector trends).</li>
        <li>Focus on liquid, quality stocks — avoiding penny stocks and highly speculative counters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>3. Timely Updates</strong></p>
      <p>You will receive updates when a trade hits its target or stop-loss, a position needs to be carried forward or closed early, or new opportunities emerge.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Risk Management Framework</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Suggested allocation per trade (so no single trade risks more than 2–3% of portfolio capital).</li>
        <li>Strict stop-loss discipline.</li>
        <li>Position sizing rules for different risk appetites (conservative / moderate / aggressive).</li>
      </ul>

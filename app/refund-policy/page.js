            <h2>Part 1: Introduction &amp; Legal Framework</h2>

            <p>
              At Growsin, I believe that fairness, transparency, and compliance must guide every client interaction. When
              clients engage me for investment advisory or research services, they place not only their trust but also their hard-earned money in the relationship. It is therefore essential to have a clear framework that governs how cancellations, refunds, and replacements are handled. This Refund, Cancellation, and Replacement Policy (“Policy”) sets out those rules.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Policy ensures that both clients and I know exactly what to expect if a service is terminated, if digital
              content is found defective, or if unexpected circumstances disrupt the delivery of services. It balances regulatory
              requirements under Indian law with practical safeguards to protect clients, while also allowing me to function
              responsibly as a registered investment adviser (RIA) and research analyst (RA).
            </p>

            <p>
              This Policy is rooted in several legal and regulatory pillars:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>SEBI Regulations:</strong> As a SEBI-registered Investment Adviser and Research Analyst, I must comply with the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013 and the SEBI (Research Analysts) Regulations, 2014. These rules govern how client fees are collected, how refunds must be processed when services are terminated, and how fairness and transparency are to be maintained. In particular, SEBI’s circulars emphasize that unexpired portions of advisory fees must be refunded when services are cut short.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Indian Contract Act, 1872:</strong> Every engagement with a client is effectively a contract. Under contract law, both parties must act in good faith, and agreements must be enforceable and fair. This Policy helps operationalize those principles by spelling out clear rules for cancellation, refund, and replacement.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Information Technology Act, 2000 and SPDI Rules:</strong> Because much of my interaction with clients is digital, I must comply with provisions that protect sensitive personal data, especially when processing payments or storing client agreements. This Policy is aligned with those obligations, ensuring that cancellations and refunds are handled securely and lawfully.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act):</strong> While primarily a data law, the DPDP Act reinforces client rights and emphasizes that personal and financial data must be processed only for lawful purposes. Refund processing and replacements involve handling sensitive information, so this Policy reflects DPDP safeguards, such as minimization, security, and accountability.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In practical terms, the Policy provides clarity on:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>When clients can cancel advisory or research services.</li>
              <li>When refunds are applicable and how they are calculated.</li>
              <li>When replacements apply for digital content or deliverables.</li>
              <li>What timelines govern refund and replacement requests.</li>
              <li>What exclusions apply, such as force majeure or consumed portions of services.</li>
              <li>How disputes are resolved, including escalation to SEBI or other forums if required.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              By documenting all of this in one place, the Policy creates predictability for clients and accountability for me.
              Clients know their rights, and I know my responsibilities. This reduces misunderstandings, prevents disputes,
              and ensures that Growsin operates in line with both regulatory requirements and professional ethics.
            </p>

            <p>
              This Policy is also designed to be client-friendly in tone. Legal rules can often seem complicated, but here they
              are presented in clear, accessible language. My goal is to empower clients with understanding, not overwhelm
              them with jargon.
            </p>

            <p>
              In summary, the Refund, Cancellation, and Replacement Policy forms part of the larger framework of
              transparency at Growsin. It reflects SEBI’s mandate, Indian law, and global best practices, while staying
              practical for a solo-adviser model. With this foundation in place, the following sections explain the objectives,
              definitions, applicability, and detailed rules that govern how cancellations, refunds, and replacements are
              handled in my practice.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="part-2">
            <h2>Part 2: Objectives of the Policy</h2>

            <p>
              A policy is only useful if its objectives are clear. The Refund, Cancellation, and Replacement Policy at Growsin
              is not just a formality — it is a practical guide that ensures clients know how their money and services are
              handled in different situations. This part explains the main objectives of the Policy and why it matters to clients
              as well as to me as an adviser.
            </p>

            <h3>Fairness to Clients</h3>
            <p>
              The first and most important objective is fairness. Clients who subscribe to advisory or research services are
              entitled to value for the fees they pay. If services are canceled early, clients should not lose the unexpired portion
              of their fees. Similarly, if digital content is defective, clients should have the right to a replacement.
            </p>

            <p>
              For example, if a client pays for a six-month advisory plan but decides to cancel after three months, the client
              should get a refund for the remaining three months. This principle ensures that clients are not disadvantaged and
              that trust in the adviser-client relationship remains strong.
            </p>

            <h3>Compliance with SEBI Regulations</h3>
            <p>
              As a SEBI-registered Investment Adviser and Research Analyst, I am bound by strict regulatory rules. SEBI
              circulars clearly state that advisers cannot retain fees for unexpired services and must have a documented refund
              policy. This Policy ensures that Growsin remains in full compliance with those obligations.
            </p>

            <h3>Transparency in Processes</h3>
            <p>
              Another key objective is transparency. Clients should never be left guessing about what happens if they cancel,
              request a refund, or seek a replacement. By documenting all the rules in this Policy, I make sure that everything
              is spelled out in advance.
            </p>

            <h3>Protection of Client Rights</h3>
            <p>
              This Policy also ensures that clients’ rights are recognized and upheld. Refunds, cancellations, and replacements
              are not discretionary — they are rights that flow from SEBI regulations and Indian law. By embedding those
              rights in this Policy, I make sure that clients are empowered to exercise them easily.
            </p>

            <h3>Professional Accountability</h3>
            <p>
              Finally, this Policy reinforces my accountability as an adviser. Since Growsin operates as a solo practice, I am
              directly responsible for implementing these rules. There is no compliance officer or internal committee;
              accountability rests with me. This direct responsibility makes the process faster, simpler, and more personal.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="part-3">
            <h2>Part 3: Key Definitions</h2>

            <p>
              To make this Policy easy to understand and to avoid confusion, a few key terms are defined here. These terms
              are used throughout the Refund, Cancellation, and Replacement Policy, and they should be read in the context of
              how services are delivered by me at Growsin.
            </p>

            <h3>Advance Fee</h3>
            <p>
              An Advance Fee is the amount a client pays before advisory or research services begin. SEBI requires advisers
              to collect fees in advance only for the agreed service period, and never beyond that. For example, if you sign up
              for a one-year advisory plan and pay the full fee upfront, that amount is the Advance Fee. If services are
              canceled midway, the unutilized portion of the Advance Fee becomes refundable.
            </p>

            <h3>Unexpired Period</h3>
            <p>
              The Unexpired Period means the portion of the service term that remains unused when a cancellation takes
              place. Refunds are always calculated with reference to this period. For example, if you subscribed for 12 months
              and cancel after 4 months, the Unexpired Period is 8 months. Refunds are based on that 8-month portion.
            </p>

            <h3>Breakage Fee</h3>
            <p>
              A Breakage Fee refers to a small deduction that may apply when a service is terminated early. This fee covers
              costs already incurred in onboarding, KYC, and administrative processes. SEBI allows such fees as long as they are fair, transparent, and disclosed upfront.
            </p>

            <h3>Consumed Fee</h3>
            <p>
              The Consumed Fee is the portion of the Advance Fee that has already been utilized by receiving services. Once a
              service has been consumed, that part of the fee is non-refundable.
            </p>

            <h3>Defective Content</h3>
            <p>
              In the context of research services, Defective Content means digital material that is not delivered as promised, is
              corrupted, or is otherwise unusable. Clients are entitled to a replacement if the content is defective.
            </p>

            <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
            <p>
              Force Majeure refers to events beyond my reasonable control that may prevent services from being delivered as
              planned. Examples include natural disasters, internet outages, government restrictions, or pandemics.
            </p>

          <section id="part-4">
            <h2>Part 4: Applicability</h2>

            <p>
              This Refund, Cancellation, and Replacement Policy applies specifically to the services I provide as a SEBI-registered Investment Adviser (RIA) and Research Analyst (RA). Because the nature of these services is different, the rules for cancellations, refunds, and replacements are also explained separately for each category.
            </p>

            <h3>Investment Advisory Services (RIA)</h3>
            <p>
              This Policy applies fully to all advisory services. That means:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clients may cancel advisory services before the end of the service period.</li>
              <li>Refunds will be calculated based on the Unexpired Period.</li>
              <li>A Breakage Fee may apply for early termination, but it will be reasonable and disclosed upfront.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Research Services (RA)</h3>
            <p>
              As a Research Analyst, I provide clients with research reports, recommendations, and digital publications on securities and investment trends. This Policy applies to research services in two key ways:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Clients may cancel a subscription before its term ends and seek a refund for the Unexpired Period.</li>
              <li>If research content provided is Defective Content (e.g., corrupted files or inaccessible links), clients may request a Replacement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Inclusions</h3>
            <p>
              This Policy covers:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>All paid advisory and research services under SEBI registration.</li>
              <li>Digital research content provided through email, website portals, or client dashboards.</li>
              <li>Refunds, cancellations, and replacements arising from service terminations, defective content, or lawful client requests.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exclusions</h3>
            <p>
              This Policy does not cover:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Third-party platforms such as broker portals, trading apps, or social media channels where I do not control the systems.</li>
              <li>Services or products not offered directly by me under SEBI registration.</li>
              <li>Situations caused by Force Majeure, such as internet outages, regulatory restrictions, or natural disasters.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section id="part-5">
            <h2>Part 5: Cancellation – Advisory Services (RIA)</h2>

            <h3>Right to Cancel</h3>
            <p>
              Clients have the right to cancel advisory services at any time during the service period. SEBI regulations allow clients the flexibility to withdraw from an advisory relationship if they no longer wish to continue.
            </p>

            <h3>Process of Cancellation</h3>
            <p>
              The cancellation process is designed to be simple and transparent:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Written Request:</strong> Clients should send a cancellation request by email to support@growsin.in (or the official communication channel provided at the time of engagement).</li>
              <li><strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> I will acknowledge the request within a reasonable time, usually within 3 business days.</li>
              <li><strong>Calculation of Unexpired Period:</strong> The effective date of cancellation will be the day the request is received. Refunds will then be calculated based on the remaining Unexpired Period.</li>
              <li><strong>Confirmation:</strong> Once the refund calculation is made, I will share the details with the client and proceed with processing.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Effective Date</h3>
            <p>
              The cancellation becomes effective from the date I receive the request, not from the date of client decision or verbal communication.
            </p>

            <h3>Impact on Services</h3>
            <p>
              Once cancellation is effective:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Advisory services stop from that date.</li>
              <li>Clients will no longer receive portfolio reviews, recommendations, or financial planning updates.</li>
              <li>Access to advisory tools, if any, will be withdrawn.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Breakage Fee</h3>
            <p>
              A small Breakage Fee may be deducted to cover administrative and onboarding costs already incurred. The fee will always be reasonable, disclosed upfront, and aligned with SEBI’s guidance.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="part-6">
            <h2>Part 6: Cancellation – Research Services (RA)</h2>

            <h3>Right to Cancel</h3>
            <p>
              Clients may cancel a research subscription at any time during the subscription period. SEBI regulations allow for refunds of the unexpired portion of fees.
            </p>

            <h3>Process of Cancellation</h3>
            <p>
              The cancellation process for research services is straightforward:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Written Request:</strong> Clients should send an email to support@growsin.in requesting cancellation of their research subscription.</li>
              <li><strong>Acknowledgment:</strong> I will confirm receipt of the request within 3 business days.</li>
              <li><strong>Effective Date:</strong> The cancellation will be effective from the date the written request is received.</li>
              <li><strong>Refund Calculation:</strong> Refunds will be based on the unused portion of the subscription (the Unexpired Period).</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Digital Nature of Services</h3>
            <p>
              Because research services involve digital content, once a report or recommendation has been delivered, that portion of the service is considered consumed and is not refundable.
            </p>

            <h3>No Hidden Deductions</h3>
            <p>
              Research subscription cancellations do not typically involve a breakage fee. The refund is a straightforward calculation of the unexpired portion of the subscription fee.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section id="part-7">
            <h2>Part 7: Refunds – Advisory Services (RIA)</h2>

            <p>
              Refunds are always calculated with reference to the Unexpired Period — the portion of the advisory service that
              remains unused after cancellation. Clients are entitled to get back the unutilized part of their Advance Fee, minus any permissible deductions.
            </p>

            <h3>Breakage Fee Deduction</h3>
            <p>
              SEBI allows advisers to charge a nominal Breakage Fee to cover onboarding and administrative costs already
              incurred. At Growsin, I keep this fee minimal and transparent. It is disclosed in advance at the time of
              engagement.
            </p>

            <h3>Consumed Fee Non-Refundable</h3>
            <p>
              The portion of the fee that covers services already delivered is called the Consumed Fee. Once services such as
              portfolio reviews, financial plans, or advisory consultations are provided, that part of the fee is non-refundable.
            </p>

            <h3>Timelines for Processing</h3>
            <p>
              Refunds are usually processed within 15 business days of receiving a valid cancellation request. Payment is typically made using the same method by which the fee was collected (such as bank transfer or UPI).
            </p>

            <h3>Transparency in Calculation</h3>
            <p>
              When a refund is issued, I provide clients with a clear breakdown of the calculation: original fee paid, duration of service consumed, duration of service unexpired, breakage fee deduction (if any), and net refund amount.
            </p>

            <h3>Refunds in Special Cases</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Client-Initiated Cancellation:</strong> Refunds apply for the unexpired portion.</li>
              <li><strong>Adviser-Initiated Cancellation:</strong> If I terminate the service due to regulatory or operational reasons, clients receive a pro-rated refund without any breakage fee.</li>
              <li><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> Refunds may not apply where services cannot be delivered due to events beyond my control.</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

          <section id="part-8">
            <h2>Part 8: Refunds – Research Services (RA)</h2>

            <p>
              Refunds for research services are guided by the same principle as advisory services: clients should never be charged for periods or services they have not used.
            </p>

            <h3>No Breakage Fee</h3>
            <p>
              Unlike advisory services, research subscriptions typically do not involve significant onboarding costs. For this reason, I do not deduct a breakage fee when processing refunds for research services.
            </p>

            <h3>Consumed Content Is Non-Refundable</h3>
            <p>
              Research content delivered before the cancellation date is considered consumed. Refunds are not issued for this portion since the service has already been rendered.
            </p>

            <h3>Timelines for Processing</h3>
            <p>
              Refunds for research services are processed within 15 business days of receiving a valid cancellation request.
            </p>

            <h3>Adviser-Initiated Refunds</h3>
            <p>
              If I ever discontinue research services due to regulatory or operational reasons, clients will receive a pro-rated refund for the unexpired portion.

              In addition to refunds, clients also have the right to expect that the services and content they receive are usable,
              accessible, and of the promised quality. Since research services and some advisory deliverables are provided
              digitally, there may occasionally be situations where content is defective, incomplete, or inaccessible. In such
              cases, the appropriate remedy is not a refund but a replacement of the content.
            </p>

            <h3>What Is Defective Content?</h3>
            <p>
              Defective Content refers to any digital material provided under a research or advisory service that cannot be
              accessed, is corrupted, incomplete, or otherwise not delivered as promised.
            </p>

            <h3>Process for Requesting Replacement</h3>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Report the Issue:</strong> The client should email me at support@growsin.in , describing the problem.</li>
              <li><strong>Verification:</strong> I will verify the issue, usually within 3 business days.</li>
              <li><strong>Replacement:</strong> If the issue is confirmed, I will provide a corrected or new version of the content promptly (usually within 7 business days).</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>No Extra Cost</h3>
            <p>
              Replacements are provided at no additional cost to the client.
            </p>

            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <p>
              Replacements do not apply where the issue is due to client-side technical problems (e.g., missing PDF reader).
            </p>

            <h2>Part 10: Refund Request &amp; Processing</h2>

            <h3>How to Request a Refund</h3>
            <p>
              Clients can request a refund by sending an email to support@growsin.in. The request should include: full name and registered email ID, service subscribed (Advisory or Research), date of subscription and payment details, and reason for cancellation or refund request.
            </p>

            <h3>Acknowledgment of Request</h3>
            <p>
              Once I receive a refund request, I send an acknowledgment within 3 business days.
            </p>

            <h3>Verification of Records</h3>
            <p>
              I review the client’s subscription details, payment records, and service usage to determine the Consumed Fee and Unexpired Period.
            </p>

            <h3>Refund Calculation</h3>
            <p>
              Refunds are calculated in line with SEBI regulations: Unexpired Period → Refundable; Consumed Fee → Non-refundable; Breakage Fee (for advisory services only) → May be deducted.
            </p>

            <h3>Timelines for Processing</h3>
            <p>
              Refunds are processed within 15 business days of receiving a valid and complete request.
            </p>

            <h3>Mode of Refund</h3>
            <p>
              Refunds are issued using the same mode of payment originally used by the client, wherever possible.
            </p>

            <h3>Compliance Trail</h3>
            <p>
              I maintain proper records of refund requests received, verification steps taken, calculation and breakdown of refund amounts, and proof of refund payment.
            </p>

            <h3>Non-Refundable Items</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Consumed Fees:</strong> Fees for services already delivered are non-refundable.</li>
              <li><strong>Delivered Content:</strong> Reports or recommendations already provided are consumed.</li>
              <li><strong>Breakage Fee:</strong> Small deduction may apply for advisory services to cover onboarding costs.</li>
              <li><strong>Third-Party Charges:</strong> Transaction/gateway fees retained by banks or payment processors may not be refundable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
            <p>
              In Force Majeure events (natural disasters, government restrictions, internet outages, pandemics), refunds or replacements may not be possible. I will, however, communicate promptly and attempt reasonable alternatives where feasible.

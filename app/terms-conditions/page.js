            <p>
              For the purposes of these Terms, a "Force Majeure Event" means any event or circumstance, or combination of events or circumstances, that is beyond our reasonable control, which prevents or materially delays our ability to perform our obligations under these Terms, including but not limited to:

              If a Force Majeure Event occurs, we shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of the occurrence of such event and its expected impact on our performance. We shall make reasonable efforts to mitigate the impact of such Force Majeure Event, but shall not be obligated to perform obligations that are rendered impossible, illegal, or impracticable by such event.

Including Compliance Officer details ensures you meet SEBI's 2021 circular requirement on grievance redressal. Adding Website URL here reinforces authenticity and makes it easier for regulators/clients to verify.
